# About the Authors {#author .unnumbered}

Yihui typed out most of the words in this book, which is the only justification for him to be the "first" author. Christophe has made substantial contribution to this book by helping Yihui organize all the GitHub issues and occasionally writing a few sections. Emily was originally a reviewer of this book. Since Yihui was not patient enough to deal with her lengthy comments, he invited her to become a co-author of this book (out of revenge) to feel his pain of having to deal with so many additional things when he thought he was pretty much done! Just kidding... No, he invited her out of full appreciation, because her comments were so helpful, yet Yihui lacked the time to do all the improvements that she suggested.

When you see the pronoun "I" in this book, it refers to Yihui. Using "I" instead of "We" does not mean the co-authors were forgotten, but Yihui wanted to express certain opinions completely of his own. He certainly wants to appear smart, but in case he is actually silly, he wants to be silly alone.

## Yihui Xie {-}

Yihui Xie (https://yihui.org) is a software engineer at RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com>). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as **knitr**, **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **xaringan**, **tinytex**, **rolldown**, **animation**, **DT**, **tufte**, **formatR**, **fun**, **xfun**, **testit**, **mime**, **highr**, **servr**, and **Rd2roxygen**, among which the **animation** package won the 2009 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award (ASA). He also co-authored a few other R packages, including **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, **pagedown**, and **leaflet**.

He has authored two books, _Dynamic Documents with knitr_ [@knitr2015], and _bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown_ [@bookdown2016], and co-authored two books, _blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown_ [@blogdown2017], and _R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_ [@rmarkdown2018].

In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (https://cosx.org), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics.

He usually reads Twitter messages once a week (https://twitter.com/xieyihui), and most of the time you can find him on GitHub (https://github.com/yihui).

He has four hobbies: reading, writing, cooking, and playing badminton. He is actually more interested in cooking than eating, but he really loves eating spicy food. When being asked "how spicy you want your food to be" in the restaurant, he usually answers "as spicy as your chef can make it to be."

## Christophe Dervieux {-}

Christophe Dervieux is an active member of the R community, currently living in France. With a Master's degree in Energy and Economics, he started working with R as an analyst doing economic studies about market designs, before becoming a developer advocate and R admin, promoting R and supporting R users where he works.

He is interested in helping others get the most from R, and you can find him wandering in RStudio Community as a sustainer, or on several GitHub issue boards for various R packages. In both places, you may better recognize him by his shorter handle "cderv".

As an R developer, he is a contributor to several R packages, such as **bookdown**, **rmarkdown**, and **knitr**. He has also co-authored the **crrri** package. His own projects can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/cderv), and sometimes he shares his ideas on Twitter (https://twitter.com/chrisderv).

He does not like spicy food, but he enjoys playing badminton every week.

## Emily Riederer {-}

Emily Riederer works in data science for the consumer finance industry where she leads a team to build analysis tools in R and cultivate an open science culture in industry. Previously, she studied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

Emily frequently discusses R on Twitter (https://twitter.com/emilyriederer) and her blog (https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/) and shared projects, including the **projmgr** R package, on GitHub (https://github.com/emilyriederer). She has also served as a package reviewer for rOpenSci and a founding co-organizer of the annual satRday Chicago R conference. 

Emily enjoys reading and weightlifting. She thinks she likes spicy food, but since she has only ever lived in the United States, she's been told that she does not really know what that actually means.
