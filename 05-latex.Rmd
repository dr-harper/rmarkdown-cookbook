# LaTeX

For many authors, the main output of their work will be the PDF report, in which case they can utilize the powerful styling of LaTeX. In this chapter, we discuss approaches that can be used to customize the output of PDF reports.

Users should approach with a note of caution. One of the major benefits of R Markdown is the fact that a single source document can create documents with multiple formats. By tailoring your work to a single output format, you may improve the appearance and performance of a single output format but at the expense of this transferability.

## Add LaTeX code to the preamble {#latex-preamble}

The general structure of a LaTeX document is like this:

```tex
\documentclass{article}
% preamble
\begin{document}
% body
\end{document}
```

That is, you declare the document class in `\documentclass{}`, load certain LaTeX packages and set certain options if necessary in the preamble, and start writing the body of your document after `\begin{document}`. A Markdown document is mostly the body of the document. If you want to add anything to the preamble, you have to use the `includes` option of `pdf_document`. This option has three sub-options: `in_header`, `before_body`, and `after_body`. Each of them takes one or multiple file paths. The file(s) specified in `in_header` will be added to the preamble. The files specified in `before_body` and `after_body` are added before and after the document body, respectively.

For example, below is a trick that turns the URLs in hyperlinks into footnotes. This trick is useful because (by default) readers do not know the actual URL when they see the text in PDF generated from `\href{URL}{text}`. This trick displays both the text and URL.

```tex
% you may want to save a copy of \href before redefining it
% \let\oldhref\href
\renewcommand{\href}[2]{#2\footnote{\url{#1}}}
```

You can save the above code in a file with an arbitrary filename, e.g., `preamble.tex`. Then include it in the preamble through:

```yaml
output:
  pdf_document:
    includes:
      in_header: "preamble.tex"
```

Another way to add code to the preamble is to use the `header-includes` field in the YAML frontmatter. We will show an example in Section \@ref(latex-logo). The advantage of using `header-includes` is that you can keep everything in one R Markdown document. However, if your report is to be generated into multiple output formats, we still recommend that you use the `includes` method, because the `header-includes` field is unconditional, and will be included in non-LaTeX output documents, too. By comparison, the `includes` option is only applied to the `pdf_document` format.

## Add logo to title page {#latex-logo}

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29389149/add-image-in-title-page-of-rmarkdown-pdf -->

We can use the **titling** LaTeX package to alter our title block to include an image. Below is a full example that shows how to add the R logo (`logo.jpg`) to the title page. The image can be of any format that LaTeX supports (e.g., `jpg`, `png`, or `pdf`).

`r import_example('latex-logo.Rmd')`

An example output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:latex-logo).

```{r latex-logo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A logo on a LaTeX title page.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/latex-logo.png", dpi = NA)
```

An alternative method that does not require a special LaTeX package (**titling**) is to just insert the image to the `title` field using the Markdown syntax. For example:

```yaml
title: |
  ![](logo.jpg){width=1in}  
  Adding a Logo to LaTeX Title
```

In this case, you will not need the `header-includes` field in the YAML frontmatter in the first example. Please note that although you cannot see them, there are two trailing spaces after `![](logo.jpg){width=1in}`, which means a linebreak in Markdown (see Section \@ref(linebreaks)). Without the linebreak, the image and the title would be on the same line, which may not be what you desire.

## Include additional LaTeX packages {#latex-extra}

<!-- https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/171711/how-to-include-latex-package-in-r-markdown/452884#452884 -->

The use of additional LaTeX packages can allow for extensive customization of document styling. In addition, several packages such as **kableExtra** [@R-kableExtra] may have LaTeX dependencies for the R package to function. Much like R, we need to load packages within the R Markdown document before we are able to use their functions.

### Loading LaTeX packages

We can load additional LaTeX packages using the `extra_dependencies` option within the `pdf_document` YAML settings. This allows us to provide a list of LaTeX packages to be loaded in the intermediate LaTeX output document, e.g.,

```yaml
---
title: "Using more LaTeX packages"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["bbm", "threeparttable"]
---
```

If you need to specify options when loading the package, you can add a second-level to the list and provide the options as a list, e.g.,

```yaml
output: 
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies:
      caption: ["labelfont={bf}"]
      hyperref: ["unicode=true", "breaklinks=true"]
      lmodern: null
```

For those familiar with LaTeX, this is equivalent to the following LaTeX code:

```tex
\usepackage[labelfont={bf}]{caption} 
\usepackage[unicode=true, breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
\userpackage{lmodern}
```

### Example packages

There is an extensive community for LaTeX, and there are over 4,000 packages available through the [Comprohensive TeX Archive Network](https://ctan.org) (CTAN). As some examples of LaTeX packages you could consider using within your report:

- [pdfpages](https://ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages): include full PDF pages from an external PDF document within your document.
- [caption](https://ctan.org/pkg/caption): change the appearance of caption subtitles. For example, you can make the figure title italic or bold.
- [fancyhdr](https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr): change the style of running headers of all pages.

## Control the placement of figures {#figure-placement}

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16626462/figure-position-in-markdown-when-converting-to-pdf-with-knitr-and-pandoc/17648350#17648350 -->
<!-- Some of the solutions adapted from https://texfaq.org/FAQ-floats. Link left here for future reference -->

One common frustration with LaTeX is the placement of figures and tables. Unlike in a word processor like Microsoft Word, in which figures are placed directly where the user specifies, LaTeX will attempt to place a figure in a position that does not violate certain typographic rules. In doing so, it can result in figures floating away from where they are referenced in the text. This section will explain some background information on how floating environments (such as figures) work, before providing several options for how to customize their behavior for your work.

### Floating environments

By default, figures with captions are generated with the `figure` environment in LaTeX. For example, Pandoc will convert the following Markdown code that contains an image

```md
![This is a figure.](images/cool.jpg)
```

to the LaTeX code:

```tex
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{images/cool.jpg}
  \caption{This is a figure.}
\end{figure}
```

The `figure` environment is a floating environment. You can read a detailed description of floats at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions. In summary, floats are used as containers for things that cannot be broken over a page, such as tables and figures. If the figure or table can not be contained in the space left on the current page, LaTeX will try to place it at the top of the next page. If the figure is tall enough, it may occupy the whole next page, even if there is still space left for a few lines of text. The behavior can be controlled by different placement specifiers in square brackets after `\begin{figure}`, e.g., `\begin{figure}[b]`. Below is a list of possible specifiers:

- `h`: Place the float _here_, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text.
- `t`: Position at the _top_ of the page.
- `b`: Position at the _bottom_ of the page.
- `p`: Put on a special _page_ for floats only.
- `!`: Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions.
- `H`: Place the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. This requires the **float** package (`\usepackage{float}`).

These specifiers can be used in conjunction, e.g., `!b` forces LaTeX to place the figure at the bottom of a page. The default behavior is `tbp`. That is, LaTeX will try to position the figure at the top of the page, then at the bottom, and then on a separate page.

### Prevent figures from floating

Many users will initially want to prevent figures from floating in their document, replicating the behavior of a traditional word processor. To do this, we must firstly load the LaTeX package **float**. This can be done by including the following line in the YAML:

```yaml
output: 
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["float"]
```

We can use the chunk option `fig.pos` to control the float behavior, and the use of `!H` will prevent any floating within the document. We can set the default behavior for the document so that all chunks have this setting by including the following line in the first code chunk in your R Markdown document:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = "!H", out.extra = "")
```

In general, we do not recommend that users force LaTeX to stop floating figures. This solution was included in this book by popular demand,^[The related Stack Overflow question has been viewed for over 45,000 times: https://stackoverflow.com/q/16626462/559676.] but there could be some serious side-effects when LaTeX is unable to float figures.

### Force floats forwards

<!-- https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/15706/force-floats-to-be-typeset-after-their-occurrence-in-the-source-text -->

An alternative to forcing all floats to be held is to force floating forwards in the text. This can remove a common issue, where a figure is shown at the top of the page before the relevant text comes. This can break the reading flow of a report. We can force it so that the figure always appears after the text by using the **flafter** LaTeX package as follows:

```yaml
output: 
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["flafter"]
```

### Adjust LaTeX placement rules

LaTeX's own float placement parameters could prevent placements that seem entirely "reasonable" to you---they are notoriously rather conservative. These defaults are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:float-default).

<!-- This table may work better as a diagram? -->

```{r float-default, echo = FALSE}
floatOpts <- data.frame(
  Command = c("topfraction", "bottomfraction", "textfraction",
              "floatpagefraction", "topnumber", "bottomnumber",
              "totalnumber"),
  Description = c("max fraction of page for floats at top",
                  "max fraction of page for floats at bottom",
                  "min fraction of page for text",
                  "min fraction of page that should have floats",
                  "max number of floats at top of page", "max number of floats at bottom of page",
                  "max number of floats on a page"),
  Default = c("0.7", "0.3", "0.2", "0.5", "2", "1", "3"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
knitr::kable(floatOpts, caption = "Default LaTeX float settings.")
```

To encourage LaTeX not to move your figures, we can alter these default settings. We could include the following in our LaTeX preamble file, reducing the minimum amount of text required on a page and allow more room for floats:

```tex
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{.85}
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{.7}
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{.15}
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{.66}
\setcounter{topnumber}{3}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{3}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}
```

If we have added these lines to a `.tex` file, we could include this file in the preamble of the LaTeX document using the method introduced in Section \@ref(latex-preamble).

## Add custom headers and footers {#latex-header}

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25329375/creating-a-footer-for-every-page-using-r-markdown -->
<!-- https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/139139/adding-headers-and-footers-using-pandoc -->

The LaTeX package **fancyhdr** has provided several commands to customize the header and footer lines of your document. For a more complete guide, please refer to the full documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr. To begin with, we must load the package. Then we can change the header style, e.g.,

```tex
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
```

The package offers three different interfaces, but we will use the commands `\fancyhead` and `\fancyfoot`. The syntax for the formatting is `\fancyhead[selectors]{output text}`, whereby the selectors state the part of the header that we wish to customize. We can use the following selectors for the page locators:

- **E** for even pages
- **O** for odd pages
- **L** for the left side
- **C** for the center
- **R** for the right side

For example, `\fancyhead[LE,RO]{Your Name}` will print the text "Your Name" on the left side of the header for even pages, and the right side for odd pages. We can combine this with additional LaTeX commands to extract details from our document for each page:

- `\thepage`: the number of the current page.
- `\thechapter`: the number of the current chapter.
- `\thesection`: the number of the current section.
- `\chaptername`: the the word "Chapter" in English, or its equivalent in the current language, or the text that the author specified by redefining this command.
- `\leftmark`: thes name and number of the current top-level structure in uppercase letters.
- `\rightmark`: the name and number of the current next to top-level structure in uppercase letters.

Below is some example LaTeX code that you can add to the preamble using the methods introduced in Section \@ref(latex-preamble):

```latex
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
% center of header
\fancyhead[CO,CE]{Your Document Header}
% center of footer
\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{And this is a fancy footer}
% page number on the left of even pages and right of odd pages
\fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
```

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30922602/creating-a-footer-for-every-page-including-first-using-r-markdown -->

By default, headers and footers will not be displayed on the first page of your PDF document. If we wish to show our footer on the front page, we must include an additional line `\fancypagestyle{plain}{\pagestyle{fancy}}`.

## LaTeX sub-figures {#latex-subfigure}

Sometimes you may want to include multiple images in a single figure environment. Sub-figures allow us to achieve this by arranging multiple images within a single environment and providing each with their own sub-caption.

Sub-figures require the LaTeX package **subfig**. We can load it via the `extra_dependencies` YAML option within the `pdf_document` output. For example:

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: "subfig"
---
```

To arrange all plots from a code chunk in sub-figures, you have to use the chunk options `fig.cap` (the caption for the whole figure environment) and `fig.subcap` (a character vector of the captions for sub-figures). For best output, you can also use the following options:

- `fig.ncol`: The number of columns of sub-figures. By default, all plots are arranged in a single row. You can break them into multiple rows.

- `out.width`: The output width of individual plots. You will normally set this to `100%` divided by the number of columns. For example, if you have two plots, the `out.width` option should be equal to or less than `50%`, otherwise the plots may exceed the page margin.

Below is an illustrative example:

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: "subfig"
---
```

````md
```{r fig-sub, fig.cap='All', fig.subcap=c('A', 'B', 'C')}`r ''`
plot(1:10)
plot(cars, pch = 19)
boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
```
````

The output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:latex-subfig). For the sake of simplicity, we omitted a few chunk options in the chunk header of the above example, including `fig.ncol = 2`, `out.width = "50%"`, `fig.align = "center"`, and the actual long captions.

```{r latex-subfig, fig.cap="An example of one figure environment containing multiple sub-figures.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/latex-subfig.png", dpi = NA)
```
