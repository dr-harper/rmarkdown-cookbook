# Managing Big Projects

- Practical tips on how a big project should be managed
- `source` is particularly useful for loading external scripts so that the R Markdown project isn't too bloated with code.

**Ideas**:
- Use `(ref:tag)` to store page formatting options which might need to be reused. For example a page break


## Sourcing Files

A benefit of using R Markdown is that it is easy 


```
source("yourScript.R")
```


## Caching

- Caching
- Ways it can be tailored to suit analysis. This cache invalidation is a great example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18376008/invalidate-a-chunks-cache-when-uncached-chunk-changes


## Notifications

- Can link R Markdown with notifications if have long analysis


- Working with non R users
- Use HTML outputs and interactive graphics

## Altering Citation Style

- Using short author citations: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48303890/using-short-author-citations-in-bookdown-rmarkdown?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa

## Automatically Generate Package Citations

<!-- TODO: May add a full example into the repository examples -->

It is important to that an acknowledgement is provided within your work to authors of any literature or software referenced. Within a typical workflow, this can be a frustrating experience if you are required to manually identify the correctly formatted citations, load them into a referencing software and then refer to them within the text. However, R Markdown makes it easy to streamline this process. We can generate a BibTex file for packages used within your analysis using the `write_bib` function within R Markdown.

```{r createBib, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'DiagrammeR'
), 'packages.bib')
```

To refer to the packages in the text, we must add `bibliography: packages.bib` to the YAML frontmatter, and then references can be made using the format `[@R-package]` where `package` is replaced with the package name i.e. `[@R-rmarkdown]`. This will be replaced with an intext citation and will be added to the bibliography at the end of your document.

Note, that the `write_bib` command is designed to overwrite the existing bibliography. If you want to manually add any other items to the bibligraphy in your document, it is recommended that you create a second `.bib` file which is also referred to within the YAML `bibliography` field, as shown below:

```yaml
---
bibliography: [packages.bib. references.bib]
---
```
