# how it works

Adding some content to put in header file.

```{cat, engine.opts=list(file = 'header.tex')}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead[CO,CE]{This is fancy header}
\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{And this is a fancy footer}
\fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
\fancypagestyle{plain}{\pagestyle{fancy}}
```

However, the aim here is to add the author name from the yaml header into the
tex template. Some R code can't be passed into the `cat` engine because it won't
be executed, but it is possible to append some more to the created file.

Here we generate the line to append in a R chunk using `knitr::knit_expand`
templating tool. Any other way to build a string will work obviously.

```{r, include = FALSE}
author_template <- knitr::knit_expand(
  text = '\\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{%rmarkdown::metadata$author%}', 
  delim = c("%", "%"))
```

Then, providing `append = TRUE` and using the `code` chunk option to provide
content to the chunk

```{cat, engine.opts=list(file = 'header.tex', append = TRUE), code = author_template}
```

This will generate a footer with the author name that we got from the yaml
header. Pretty advanced combination !

# Some other content to see the footer

\lipsum[1-30]
